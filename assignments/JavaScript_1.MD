1. Create a RESUME using HTML,CSS and JavaScript
2. Create a Feedback form using HTML,CSS and JavaScript

# üî¢ Task 3: Interactive Counter Application

## üìù Task Description
Create an interactive counter application that displays a number and allows users to manipulate it using three buttons.

## ‚úÖ Requirements
1. Create an HTML page with:
  - A display area showing the current count (starting at 0)
  - Three buttons labeled:
    * "+" (increment)
    * "-" (decrement)
    * "Reset"

2. Implement the following functionality:
  - When the "+" button is clicked, the counter should increase by 1
  - When the "-" button is clicked, the counter should decrease by 1
  - When "Reset" is clicked, the counter should return to 0

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements
1. Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
2. The counter display must update immediately after each button click
3. The counter value should be visible on the page at all times
4. All buttons should be clickable and functional at all times

## ‚≠ê Bonus Challenges
- Add a visual feedback when buttons are clicked
- Prevent the counter from going below 0
- Add keyboard shortcuts (arrow up/down for +/- and 'R' for reset)


# üìê Task 4: 3D Geometry Calculator & Cheatsheet

## üìù Task Description
Create an interactive calculator that computes volume and surface area for various 3D geometric shapes. The application should include formulas for reference and perform calculations based on user input.

## ‚úÖ Requirements
1. Create HTML sections for the following shapes:
  - Cube
  - Sphere
  - Cylinder
  - Cone
  - Rectangular Prism

2. For each shape, include:
  - A visual representation or diagram
  - The formulas for both volume and surface area
  - Input fields for required measurements
    * Length, width, height for rectangular prism
    * Radius, height for cylinder/cone
    * Side length for cube
    * Radius for sphere

3. Implement the following functionality:
  - Real-time calculation as users input values
  - Clear display of both volume and surface area results
  - Input validation for negative numbers
  - Reset button for each shape's calculations

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements
1. Use vanilla JavaScript for calculations
2. All input fields must accept numerical values only
3. Results should update immediately after input changes
4. Display calculations with appropriate units (cubic units for volume, square units for surface area)
5. Include proper error handling for invalid inputs

## ‚≠ê Bonus Challenges
- Add unit conversion (between metric and imperial)
- Implement a "copy to clipboard" feature for results
- Add animations or 3D visualizations of shapes
- Include a "compare shapes" feature to display multiple results side by side


5. Create a multiplayer dice
6. Random Number Guesser
