1. How many passengers were on the Titanic?

2. What was the survival rate (percentage) of passengers?

3. List all unique passenger classes in the dataset.

4. How many passengers embarked from each port?

5. What was the average fare paid by passengers?

6. Find the names and ages of all passengers who were under 18 and survived.

7. Calculate the average fare for each passenger class.

8. How many passengers had siblings or spouses aboard, grouped by survival status?

9. List the top 10 most expensive ticket fares and the passengers who paid them.

10. Find the number of passengers who had cabin information (not null) vs those who didn't.

11. Calculate the survival rate for each combination of gender and passenger class.

12. Find the age group (0-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc.) with the highest survival rate.

13. List passengers who paid more than twice the average fare for their passenger class.

14. Calculate the percentage of survivors for passengers traveling alone vs those traveling with family (SibSp + Parch > 0).

15. Find cabins that had multiple passengers, along with the count of passengers in each cabin (excluding null cabins).

16. Create a summary showing the survival rate by passenger class and embarkation port, but only for groups with more than 50 passengers.

17. Find passengers who paid higher fares than the average fare of their respective passenger class and survived the journey.

18. Calculate the median age of survivors vs non-survivors (you might need to write a more complex query depending on your SQL version).

19. Create a query that ranks passengers within their class based on fare paid, and show the top 3 from each class.

20. Find the most common ticket numbers (shared by multiple passengers) and calculate the average survival rate for passengers sharing these tickets.
