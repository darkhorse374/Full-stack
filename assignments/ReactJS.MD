# ReactJS Foundational Problems

1. Break Down the UI into Components  
   Take a look at the provided UI. Your task is to divide it into multiple React components. You don't need to write any code for this step. Simply use a pen and paper or a photo editing tool to visualize how the UI can be split into different components. This exercise will help you get a better understanding of component structure in React.

## 2. Create a Greet Component
 
- Create a new file called `Greet.jsx` and inside that file, write a `Greet` component using the **function declaration** syntax.
- Afterward, refactor the `Greet` component to use the **arrow function** syntax.
- Finally, register the `Greet` component in your `App.jsx` file so that you can see the result when running the app.



## 3. Rendering Multiple Components and Nesting Components

In this exercise, you will learn how to create multiple components and render one component inside another.

Step 1: Create a Header Component

1. Create a new file called `Header.jsx`.
2. Inside this file, create a functional component named `Header`.
3. The `Header` component should return a `<header>` element with the following:
   - A `<h1>` element with the text "Welcome to My Portfolio!"
   - A `<nav>` element containing three links (`<a>`) with the text "Home", "About", and "Contact"

Step 2: Create a Footer Component

1. Create a new file called `Footer.jsx`.
2. Inside this file, create a functional component named `Footer`.
3. The `Footer` component should return a `<footer>` element with a `<p>` containing the text "Â© 2025 Your Name"

Step 3: Create a MainContent Component

1. Create a new file called `MainContent.jsx`.
2. Inside this file, create a functional component named `MainContent`.
3. The `MainContent` component should return a `<main>` element containing:
   - A `<h2>` element with the text "Main Content"
   - A `<p>` element with any text of your choice

 Step 4: Render Components Inside App.jsx

1. In your `App.jsx` file, import the `Header`, `MainContent`, and `Footer` components:
   ```jsx
   import Header from "./Header";
   import MainContent from "./MainContent";
   import Footer from "./Footer";
   ```

2. Inside the `App` component's return statement, render the three components inside a single `<div>`, in the following order:
   - `Header`
   - `MainContent`
   - `Footer`

Your `App.jsx` should look like this:
```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <MainContent />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
